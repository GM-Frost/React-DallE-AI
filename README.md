# Project Description
This is is Practice Project. This project is a React-based web application that utilizes Vitejs as the frontend framework. The application leverages AI image generation functionality, where users can input prompts to generate AI-generated images. Additionally, there is a pre-prompt function that can be generated by clicking a button. The AI image generation is powered by DallE-OpenAI. The backend of the application is built with MongoDB, where most of the user-generated images are stored. Cloudinary is used for enhancing, optimizing, and storing various user-generated images.
